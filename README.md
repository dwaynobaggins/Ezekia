# Ezekia Task:

## Context
You manage a natural history museum website. The museum has a set of web pages, each with a theme, and containing a list of that theme's highlights within the museum's exhibits.
These pages include Dinosaurs, Space, Oceans, and Wildlife.

## Goal
Display the Space page highlights on cards in a list using the museum's data combined with data from the partner's API.

## General Guidelines:
* Use the Options API
* Use ES6 notation
* Use SCSS
* Use BEM for classes if possible
* Using Typescript is *not* necessary
* Using Lodash would make some functions a lot easier! (https://lodash.com/docs/4.17.15)
* Do *not*  modify the arrays/objects in "data()"

# Solution:

## Clone this repository

     git clone https://github.com/dwaynobaggins/Ezekia.git 
     
## Install the dependencies (Project Setup)

     npm install  

NB: Don't forget to go into the project folder before install!

## Run the project on localhost

     npm run dev

## Notes on this Project

I chose to complete this task using Vue with a from scratch project, to demonstrate that I know how to scaffold a new Vue project using the latest packages and best practices for project setup. Although this project was written in Options API as per spec, I could update it quickly to Composition API (recommended) if required.
I used global styles where possible, with the intention of keeping the broader scope of the project in mind while maintaining component driven architecture.
